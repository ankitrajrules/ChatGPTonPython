      "The recent surge in COVID-19 cases in India has caused widespread disruption and concern over the potential impact of a second wave. The country has recorded the highest daily rise in infections in a single day since the pandemic began, with more than 83,000 new cases on April 21 2021. The strain on the healthcare system is immense as more and more people are put on ventilators due to the sheer number of infections. This is a worrying situation as India is already facing a huge shortage of oxygen and other necessary medical resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of economic impact, the second wave of the pandemic could cause further disruption in the already weakened economy. Job losses could increase, businesses could suffer, and activity in the services sector such as hospitality, travel and tourism could take another hit. In addition, the disruption caused by lockdowns and other restrictions could further add to the economic woes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The government’s focus rightly remains on containing the pandemic and mitigating the impact on the health system. But it must also pay attention to the long-term economic implications. Employer-centric policies, such as temporarily suspending labour laws to provide relief to small businesses, could help keep people in jobs. The government should also focus on getting essential resources to those who need them and ensure adequate testing in place. These measures could be key to limiting the economic impact of the second wave.\n"
